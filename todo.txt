To Do:

- Board inputs to different outputs
    - to MIDI
    - to OSC
    - OSC to Wekinator
        - from Wekinator back to Server and then to MIDI

    - different output methods
        - straight through (board input goes directly to output)
        - remapped (output goes from 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 etc.)
        - threshold trigger (send 1 message if an input value reaches a threshold)
        - threshold pass (send all inputs as outputs if they're within a given value range)

- Threading for the listen loop?


Ideas:

Osculator
TouchOSC on mobile
^ combo?
