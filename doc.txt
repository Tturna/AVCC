As of 2023.3.1, the Arduino client “tracker-osc-standalone” is the best.
It doesn’t use the custom python server at all. It directly sends OSC data
via wifi which can be processed by Wekinator and Osculator.

As of 2023.7.20, the client "trackerserverless" is the best and the one
that's being updated. Does the same thing as the osc standalone one,
but also has accelerometer data.
